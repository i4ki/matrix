// 1 experiment
// i4k

// Based on ideas from:
//   - curiosity based learning
//   - Matrix 1

// Randon thoughts:
//
// 1. Input mechanisms influences reasoning
// 2. Reasoning is just comparison of choices made for every input processed
// 3. If the machine survives in the first N events, then what he learnt is
//    stored in their memory and ready to be transmitted/copied for their successors.

// But, what I'll experiment here?

// The creature will have a single mechanism of acquiring information.
// Based on this information, it can DIE or LIVE
// Initially, it doesn't know what it should do to live. It only makes a
// random choice and waits to see what happens...

// The *key* here is that creature have the *will* to continue to explore
// the external world. Why? I don't know, but nature shows that this is true.

// Depends on cmd/lifevm
